# Movie Trailer Website

## Introduction
This program is a Python demonstration program for the Udacity Full Stack Nano Degree Program.  The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the capabilities of Python as a server side language for use in creating dynamic webpages.

## Getting Started
Find the media.py, entertainment_center.py, and fresh_tomatoes.py files and copy them to your local machine or web server.  Open the entertainment_center.py file and run the program.  This file will open a new tab in an open webbrowser or open a new webbrowser to display the content.  Click on the movie images to see any of the trailers on the site.

## Design of the Program
This program is comprised of three files.  

### media.py
The primary class of the program is Movie and is contained within the media.py file.  In this file are the variable declarations and initialization parameters of class.  All information passed to this class is in the form of a string.

### entertainment_center.py
This file contains the data for each of the movies listed as a part of the displayed website.  Each instance of Movie contains four sets of data to be passed to the class "Movie".  
1) The title of movie. 
2) A brief description of the storyline. 
3) A link to artwork representing the movie.  
4) A link to the movie trailer as found on YouTube.com

### fresh_tomatoes.py
This file contains all of the html, css, and javascript required to display the webpage properly.

## Credits
The basis for this program is provided during the course for the Full Stack Nanodegree offered by Udacity.  The template for fesh_tomatoes.py is credited to Udacity.  The author of this complete program has made suitable updates to the code and adapted to fit the design requirements.
